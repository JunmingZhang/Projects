We did not implement a way to rearrange extents. So after a long term of use, our file system suffers from fragmentization as deleting and creating file makes
the file system harder and harder to mannage and the efficiency will be lower. Each newly created extents will be short in size so that it cannot effectively store
large consecutive blocks, which makes read and write slower. Also since there are finite number of extents associate to a file, we will potentially waste some spaces
with lack of extents for each file if the file are running out of extents and we currently have no optimal way to avoid this.
