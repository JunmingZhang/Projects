### Introduction
This is a Drifting bottle web app created by Team41.
This web app is aiming to helps people with their mental well-being. We provide users with sequences of reflective questions inspired by psychotherapy such as Action and Commitment Therapy(ACT) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy(CBT). Users answers to these guiding questions are saved on their timeline for future review, in the form of journals.  Users are able to view otherâ€™s answers anonymously and left comments with permission. We hope the Drifting Bottle app could give people a pure land to become people's hearts.
