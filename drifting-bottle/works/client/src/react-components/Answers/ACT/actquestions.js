    just a thought. Now give yourself a chance to reflect on the mental  \
    shift which might have occurred, or at least started to take place. How would you describe the experience as you moved from  \
    ‘fusion with’ to ‘defusion from’ the thought?",

   and if that's true, you can use the thought to help you! But more often than not, these thought don't motivate you\
   that well. What usually happens is that they bring us down through guilt, shame,\
    and anxiety. Now reflect if this is true in your case.",
